## My example cart

[an example file ](url)`buut.tic` which contains some basic collision checking and some ideas for code structuring.

Download the file to your computer. *You can't open a*`.tic` *file by just clicking it* - you have to open it in TIC-80. And to get TIC-80 to see it, move the file to TIC-80's **data folder,** which is the *only folder TIC-80 can see in your computer*. It's easily accessed by executing the command

    folder

Which opens the folder in file explorer. By default, the folder only contains the folder `.local `and nothing else.

Move the file `buut.tic` to the data folder (not inside `.local`). You can see the contents of the data folder with commands `ls `or `dir` and open the file with command

    load buut

**The editors**

The command line isn't everything, though: you can open the five **editors** with buttons **F1-F5** (or command **edit)**: code editor, sprite editor, map editor, sound effect editor and music editor. We're only going to need the first three editors now. You can jump between the editors and the command line with **ESC** button.

**The code editor**

Write your game code here! You can change the editor font to a bit smaller one with the **F** button on the top right. The three bars button shows the **outline**, or the *list of functions* in use.

**The sprite editor**

Draw your characters, backgrounds and everything else here.

**The map editor**

To jump between close-up view and a general view of the whole map, use **Tab**.

To add stuff to the tile map, press and hold **Shift** and choose the tile you want to use.

**music editor**
press 1 to add "stop note" command
press delete to remove a note OR aforementioned stop note command.
